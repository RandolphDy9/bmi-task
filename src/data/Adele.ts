      title: "Set Fire To The Rain",
      lyrics: `
      All the things you'd say
      All the things you'd say
      All the things you'd say

      I let it fall, my heart
      And as it fell, you rose to claim it
      It was dark and I was over
      Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

      My hands, they're strong
      But my knees were far too weak
      To stand in your arms
      Without falling to your feet

      But there's a side to you
      That I never knew, never knew
      All the things you'd say
      They were never true, never true
      And the games you play
      You would always win, always win

      But I set fire to the rain
      Watched it pour as I touched your face
      Well, it burned while I cried
      'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
      Your name

      But I set fire to the rain
      Watched it pour as I touched your face
      Well, it burned while I cried
      'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
      Your name

      All the things you'd say
      But I set fire
      All the things you'd say
      All the things you'd say`,

      lyrics: `
      Hello, it's me
      I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
      To go over everything
      They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

      Hello, can you hear me?
      I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
      When we were younger and free
      I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

      There's such a difference between us
      And a million miles

      Hello from the other side
      I must've called a thousand times
      To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
      But when I call, you never seem to be home

      Hello from the outside
      At least I can say that I've tried
      To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
      But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

      Hello, how are you?
      It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
      I hope that you're well
      Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
      It's no secret that the both of us
      Are running out of time

      So hello from the other side (other side)
      I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
      To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
      But when I call, you never seem to be home
      Hello from the outside (outside)

      At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
      To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
      But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

      Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
      (Highs, highs, highs, highs)
      Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
      (Highs, highs, highs, highs)
      Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
      (Highs, highs, highs, highs)
      Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)
      
      Hello from the other side (other side)
      I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
      To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
      But when I call, you never seem to be home

      Hello from the outside (outside)
      At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

      lyrics: `
      When the rain is blowing in your face
      And the whole world is on your case
      I could offer you a warm embrace
      To make you feel my love

      When the evening shadows and the stars appear
      And there is no one there to dry your tears
      I could hold you for a million years
      To make you feel my love

      I know you haven't made your mind up yet
      But I will never do you wrong
      I've known it from the moment that we met
      No doubt in my mind where you belong

      I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
      I'd go crawling down the avenue
      No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
      To make you feel my love

      The storms are raging on the rolling sea
      And on the highway of regret
      The winds of change are blowing wild and free
      You ain't seen nothing like me yet

      I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
      Nothing that I wouldn't do
      Go to the ends of the Earth for you
      To make you feel my love
      To make you feel my love`,
