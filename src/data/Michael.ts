      title: "Billie Jean",
      lyrics: `
      She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
      I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
      Who will dance on the floor in the round?
      She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

      She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
      Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
      Who will dance on the floor in the round

      People always told me be careful of what you do
      And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
      And mother always told me be careful of who you love
      And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

      Billie Jean is not my lover
      She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
      But the kid is not my son
      She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

      For forty days and forty nights
      The law was on her side
      But who can stand when she's in demand
      Her schemes and plans
      'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
      So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
      (Do think twice, do think twice)

      She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
      Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
      'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

      People always told me be careful of what you do
      And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
      She came and stood right by me
      Just the smell of sweet perfume
      This happened much too soon
      She called me to her room

      Billie Jean is not my lover
      She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
      But the kid is not my son

      Billie Jean is not my lover
      She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
      But the kid is not my son
      She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
      She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

      Billie Jean is not my lover
      She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
      But the kid is not my son
      She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
      She says I am the one
      You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
      She says I am the one

      Billie Jean is not my lover
      Billie Jean is not my lover
      Billie Jean is not my lover
      Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
      Billie Jean is not my lover
      Billie Jean is not my lover

      As he came into the window
      It was the sound of a crescendo
      He came into her apartment
      He left the bloodstains on the carpet
      She ran underneath the table
      He could see she was unable
      So she ran into the bedroom
      She was struck down
      It was her doom

      Annie, are you okay?
      So, Annie, are you okay?
      Are you okay, Annie?
      Annie, are you okay?
      So, Annie, are you okay?
      Are you okay, Annie?
      Annie, are you okay?
      So, Annie, are you okay?
      Are you okay, Annie?
      Annie, are you okay?
      So, Annie, are you okay?
      Are you okay, Annie?

      Annie, are you okay?
      Will you tell us that you're okay?
      There's a sign in the window
      That he struck you - a crescendo, Annie
      He came into your apartment
      He left the bloodstains on the carpet
      Then you ran into the bedroom
      You were struck down
      It was your doom
      Annie, are you okay?
      So, Annie, are you okay?
      Are you okay, Annie?

      You've been hit by
      You've been hit by a smooth criminal

      Ow!
      Ow!
      Aw!

      Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
      Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
      There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
      Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
      He came into your apartment (I don't know)
      Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
      And then you ran into the bedroom (help me)
      You were struck down
      It was your doom Annie (dag gone it)

      Annie, are you okay?
      So, Annie, are you okay?
      Are you okay, Annie?
      You've been hit by
      You've been hit by a smooth criminal

      title: "You Are Not Alone",
      lyrics: `
      Another day has gone
      I'm still all alone
      How could this be?
      You're not here with me
      You never said goodbye
      Someone tell me why
      Did you have to go?
      And leave my world so cold

      Everyday I sit and ask myself
      How did love slip away?
      Something whispers in my ear and says

      That you are not alone
      I am here with you
      Though you're far away
      I am here to stay
      But you are not alone
      I am here with you
      Though we're far apart
      You're always in my heart
      But you are not alone

      'Lone, 'lone
      Why, 'lone

      Just the other night
      I thought I heard you cry
      Asking me to come
      And hold you in my arms
      I can hear your prayers
      Your burdens I will bear
      But first I need your hand
      Then forever can begin

      Everyday I sit and ask myself
      How did love slip away?
      Something whispers in my ear and says

      That you are not alone
      I am here with you
      Though you're far away
      I am here to stay
      But you are not alone
      I am here with you
      Though we're far apart
      You're always in my heart
      But you are not alone

      Whisper three words and I'll come running
      And girl you know that I'll be there
      I'll be there

      That you are not alone
      I am here with you
      Though you're far away
      I am here to stay
      But you are not alone
      I am here with you
      Though we're far apart
      You're always in my heart

      For you are not alone (You are not alone)
      For I am here with you (I am here with you)
      Though you're far away (Though you're far away)
      I am here to stay (You and me)
      For you are not alone (You're always in my heart)
      For I am here with you
      Though we're far apart
      You're always in my heart

      For you are not alone
      Not alone, oh
      You are not alone
      You are not alone
      Say it again
      You are not alone
      You are not alone
      Not alone, not alone

      If you just reach out for me girl
      In the morning, in the evening
      Not alone, not alone
      You and me
      Not alone
      Oh, together, together
      Gotta stop being alone
      Gotta stop being alone
