      title: "Shake it off",
      lyrics: `
      I stay out too late
      Got nothing in my brain
      That's what people say, mm-mm
      That's what people say, mm-mm
      I go on too many dates
      But I can't make 'em stay
      At least that's what people say, mm-mm
      That's what people say, mm-mm

      But I keep cruisin'
      Can't stop, won't stop movin'
      It's like I got this music in my mind
      Sayin' it's gonna be alright

      'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
      And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
      Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
      I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)
      Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
      And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
      Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
      I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)

      I never miss a beat
      I'm lightnin' on my feet
      And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
      That's what they don't see, mm-mm
      I'm dancin' on my own (dancin' on my own)
      I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
      And that's what they don't know, mm-mm
      That's what they don't know, mm-mm

      But I keep cruisin'
      Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
      It's like I got this music in my mind
      Sayin' it's gonna be alright

      'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
      And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
      Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
      I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)
      Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
      And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
      Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
      I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)
      Shake it off, I shake it off

      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)

      Hey, hey, hey
      Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
      And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
      You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat

      My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
      She's like, "Oh my God!" but I'm just gonna shake
      And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
      Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake (yeah)
      Yeah, oh, oh
      
      'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
      And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
      Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
      I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)

      Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmm)
      And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake and fake and fake)
      Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
      I shake it off, I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)

      Shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off (yeah), I shake it off (hoo-hoo-hoo)

      Shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
      I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off`,

      lyrics: `
      I'm so glad you made time to see me
      How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
      I haven't seen them in a while
      You've been good, busier than ever
      We small talk, work and the weather
      Your guard is up and I know why

      Because the last time you saw me
      Is still burned in the back of your mind
      You gave me roses and I left them there to die

      So this is me swallowin' my pride
      Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
      And I go back to December all the time
      It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
      Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
      I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
      I go back to December all the time

      These days, I haven't been sleepin'
      Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
      When your birthday passed and I didn't call
      Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
      I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
      And realized I loved you in the fall

      And then the cold came, the dark days
      When fear crept into my mind
      You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

      So this is me swallowin' my pride
      Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
      And I go back to December all the time
      It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
      Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
      I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
      I go back to December all the time

      I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
      So good to me, so right
      And how you held me in your arms that September night
      The first time you ever saw me cry
      Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
      Probably mindless dreamin'
      But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

      I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
      So if the chain is on your door, I understand

      But this is me swallowin' my pride
      Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
      And I go back to December
      It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
      Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
      I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
      I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
      I go back to December all the time
      All the time`,

      title: "Love Story",
      lyrics: `
      We were both young when I first saw you
      I close my eyes and the flashback starts
      I'm standin' there
      On a balcony in summer air
      See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
      See you make your way through the crowd
      And say, "Hello"
      Little did I know

      That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
      And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
      And I was cryin' on the staircase
      Beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said

      Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
      I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
      You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
      It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

      So I sneak out to the garden to see you
      We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
      So close your eyes
      Escape this town for a little while, oh oh

      'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
      And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
      But you were everything to me
      I was beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said

      Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
      I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
      You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
      It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
      Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
      This love is difficult, but it's real
      Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
      It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
      Oh, oh

      I got tired of waiting
      Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
      My faith in you was fading
      When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

      Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
      I keep waiting for you, but you never come
      Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
      He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
      And said, "Marry me, Juliet
      You'll never have to be alone
      I love you and that's all I really know
      I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
      It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
      Oh, oh, oh
      Oh, oh, oh, oh
      'Cause we were both young when I first saw you`,
