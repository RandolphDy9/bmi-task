      lyrics: `
      And, they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
      They wishin' on me, yeah

      I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
      Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
      Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
      You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
      I don't wanna die for them to miss me
      Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
      Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
      They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me

      God's plan, God's plan
      I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah
      I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
      I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
      Might go down a G-O-D, yeah, wait
      I go hard on Southside G, yeah, Way
      I make sure that north side eat
      And still

      Bad things
      It's a lot of bad things
      That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
      They wishin' on me
      Bad things
      It's a lot of bad things
      That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
      They wishin' on me
      Yeah, ayy, ayy (ayy)

      She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
      I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry"
      Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
      81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
      And you know me
      Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
      Without 40, Oli', there'd be no me
      'Magine if I never met the broskis

      God's plan, God's plan
      I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
      Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
      I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
      Might go down as G-O-D, yeah, wait
      I go hard on Southside G, ayy, Way
      I make sure that north side eat, yuh
      And still

      Bad things
      It's a lot of bad things
      That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
      They wishin' on me
      Yeah, yeah
      Bad things
      It's a lot of bad things
      That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
      They wishin' on me
      Yeah`,

      lyrics: `
      Baby, I like your style

      Grips on your waist
      Front way, back way
      You know that I don't play
      Streets not safe
      But I never run away
      Even when I'm away
      OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT
      I pray to make it back in one piece
      I pray, I pray

      That's why I need a one dance
      Got a Hennessy in my hand
      One more time 'fore I go
      Higher powers taking a hold on me
      I need a one dance
      Got a Hennessy in my hand
      One more time 'fore I go
      Higher powers taking a hold on me

      Baby, I like your style
      Strength and guidance
      All that I'm wishin' for my friends
      Nobody makes it from my ends
      I had to bust up the silence
      You know you gotta stick by me
      Soon as you see the text, reply me
      I don't wanna spend time fighting
      We've got no time

      And that's why I need a one dance
      Got a Hennessy in my hand
      One more time 'fore I go
      Higher powers taking a hold on me
      I need a one dance
      Got a Hennessy in my hand
      One more time 'fore I go
      Higher powers taking a hold on me

      Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
      Wine it, wine it, and she love me long time
      Ooh yeah, just steady and wine up
      Back up, back up, back up and wine up
      Back up, back up and wine it
      Girl, just back up, back up, back up and wine down
      Ooh yeah, just steady and wine up
      Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

      Ooh, tell me
      I need to know, where do you wanna go?
      'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
      Make you lose control
      Where, where, where
      Where, where, where, where (ooh yeah, very long time)
      (Back, up, back up and wine it, girl)
      'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
      'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
      'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)

      I need a one dance

      lyrics: `
      You gotta motherfuckin' feel this shit, boy
      (BanBwoi)
      Woah

      I got feelings for you
      Hope you ain't lovin' the crew
      How many bodies you got?
      Pray it ain't more than a few
      Know that you dealt with some lames
      When you was young and in school
      He had to pop your cherry
      But I got it wet like a pool

      She got a new G-Wag'
      She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
      Got a new body, girl, show it off
      This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
      Toned up and she got a six-pack
      Look like she used to play volleyball
      American Express, you can have it all
      Code to the safe, you can have it all

      Fuck your main page, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
      You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
      You want a boutique or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into
      If you out in public, and he want your number, just tell him, "My nigga'll spin you"

      The way you make me feel these days
      Somethin' gettin' dry for you, baby girl
      Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
      Burn somebody block for you
      The way you make me feel these days
      Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
      Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
      Comin' out my body for you

      Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
      Are makin' laws about what women can do
      I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby
      So I gotta respect ya
      Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is pressure
      Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
      Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
      Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
      The texts that you send in captions
      The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum

      Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
      She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
      You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
      They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
      Jealous-ass hoes, yeah

      And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue
      But just like that R&B group from the '90s
      Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
      One call, you in runway shows
      One call, I'm sittin' front row
      One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
      One call and my niggas ten toes
      Down to go wherever I say go
      Even if we gotta travel 'cross the globe
      Down to take you to the end of the road, for real

      The way you make me feel these days
      Somethin' gettin' dry for you, baby girl
      Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
      Burn somebody block for you
      The way you make me feel these days
      Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
      Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
      Comin' out my body for you

      Want ya, I want-want ya
      Oh, your lovin' so deep (feelin' so deep)
      Want ya, I want-want ya
      Give me your lovin' (feelin' so deep)`,
