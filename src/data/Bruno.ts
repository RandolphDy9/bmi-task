      title: "Billionaire",
      lyrics: `
      I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad
      Buy all of the things I never had
      I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
      Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

      Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
      Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
      I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
      And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-
      Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this"
      And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
      It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
      You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho-ho

      Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
      And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
      Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
      Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

      Oh, every time I close my eyes
      (What you see? What you see, bruh?)
      I see my name in shining lights
      (Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
      A different city every night
      Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
      For when I'm a billionaire
      Oh-oh, oh-oh
      When I'm a billionaire
      Oh-oh, oh-oh

      I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
      Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
      Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
      But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Ben's completely separate

      And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
      We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
      I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
      So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

      And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
      Eating good, sleeping soundly
      I know we all have a similar dream
      Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

      I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad (so bad)
      Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything)
      I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
      Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up, Oprah?)

      Oh, every time I close my eyes (what you see? What you see bruh?)
      I see my name in shining lights (uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?)
      A different city every night
      Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
      For when I'm a billionaire
      Oh-oh, oh-oh
      When I'm a billionaire
      Oh-oh, oh-oh

      Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
      Take, take, take it all, but you never give
      Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
      Had your eyes wide open
      Why were they open? (Ooh-ooh)

      Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash (ooh-ooh)
      You tossed it in the trash, you did (ooh-ooh)
      To give me all your love is all I ever ask
      'Cause what you don't understand is

      I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
      Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
      I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
      You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

      Oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
      Take a bullet straight through my brain
      Yes, I would die for ya, baby
      But you won't do the same

      No, no, no, no
      Uh

      Black, black, black and blue
      Beat me 'til I'm numb
      Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
      Mad woman, bad woman
      That's just what you are
      Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car (ooh-ooh)

      Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash (ooh-ooh)
      You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did (ooh-ooh)
      To give me all your love is all I ever ask

      You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

      Oh oh, I would go through all this pain
      Take a bullet straight through my brain
      Yes, I would die for ya, baby
      But you won't do the same

      if my body was on fire
      (No) ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
      (No) you said you loved me, you're a liar
      'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

      But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
      Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
      I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
      You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

      Take a bullet straight through my brain
      Yes, I would die for ya, baby

      No, you won't do the same
      You wouldn't do the same
      Ooh, you'd never do the same
      No, no, no, no-oh

      Today, I don't feel like doing anything
      I just wanna lay in my bed
      Don't feel like picking up my phone
      So leave a message at the tone
      'Cause today, I swear I'm not doing anything

      Uh, I'm gonna kick my feet up then stare at the fan
      Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
      Nobody's gon' tell me, I can't, nah
      I'll be lounging on the couch, just chilling in my Snuggie
      Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
      'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man

      Oh-oh, yes, I said it, I said it
      I said it 'cause I can

      Today, I don't feel like doing anything
      I just wanna lay in my bed
      Don't feel like picking up my phone
      So leave a message at the tone
      'Cause today, I swear I'm not doing anything

      Nothing at all (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
      Nothing at all (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

      Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
      Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
      And she's gonna scream out, "This is great"
      (Oh, my God, this is great) yeah

      I might mess around and get my college degree
      I bet my old man will be so proud of me
      But sorry, pops, you'll just have to wait

      Oh-oh-oh, yes, I said it, I said it
      I said it 'cause I can

      Today, I don't feel like doing anything
      I just wanna lay in my bed
      Don't feel like picking up my phone
      So leave a message at the tone
      'Cause today, I swear I'm not doing anything

      No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
      'Cause I ain't going anywhere
      No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh
      I'll just strut in my birthday suit
      And let everything hang loose
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

      Oh-oh-oh, today, I don't feel like doing anything
